# BitMiner PHP ver.
BitMiner was a project made by me and my boi Eldrin Joshua. The original BitMiner was built using C# ASP.NET framework with IoT technology for the Arduino, Wemos, and Sensors.

However, this BitMiner only features the web-part of the original system. Also, this versionw as built, not with C# ASP.NET, but with OOP PHP with the MVC framework and PDO for the backend.

This small project was made as a self feedback of mine after watching courses regarding OOP PHP, the MVC model, and PDO. This project took me roughly... 5 HOURS to accomplish (breaks included).

It currently lacks MODIFICATION and DELETION of records, but it is working for the most part. It has a login module, signup module, and a dashboard for the machine.

# NOTE
This project requires MySQL to run. I may or may not include the table query of this project.
